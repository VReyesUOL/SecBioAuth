# Secure Biometric Authentication in under a second by means of TFHE

This repository contains an implementation of a secure biometric authentication protocol. 
It leverages the tfhe-rs library in order to accomplish this.

Slight adaptation of the tfhe-rs library is necessary for this to work. We provide a patch for the commit 5e3b793.
